Project details:
Dataset info: The supply chain dataset comprises 24 columns and 100+ rows, containing information on various aspects of the supply chain, including product details, pricing, availability, sales, manufacturing, shipping, and costs. 

Problem statement: The supply chain dataset presents a comprehensive set of information related to product sales, manufacturing, and logistics. The challenge is to extract meaningful insights and actionable recommendations from the data to optimize supply chain operations and improve profitability.

Tools used: Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
MSSQL Server for SQL
Power BI

Python analysis:
Sales Analysis:
1️⃣ Analyze the number of products sold and revenue generated to understand sales performance over time.

2️⃣ Identify customer demographics to determine which groups are purchasing the most products.

3️⃣ Track availability and stock levels to ensure the right products are in stock when customers are ready to buy.

Operational Analysis:
1️⃣ Analyze lead times, order quantities, and production volumes to optimize inventory management and reduce stockouts.

2️⃣ Track manufacturing lead times and costs to identify areas for improvement and cost savings.

3️⃣ Monitor inspection results and defect rates to identify quality issues and improve manufacturing processes.

Shipping Analysis:
1️⃣ Analyze costs, transportation modes, and routes to optimize logistics and reduce shipping costs.

2️⃣ Monitor shipping times, shipping carriers, and modes of transportation to ensure timely delivery to customers.

3️⃣ Track shipping costs associated with shipping carriers and revenue generated to identify areas for cost savings.

Libraries Used for the Analysis:
Data Manipulation: NumPy, Pandas

Data Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib

SQL analysis:
Total Revenue by Product Type: Calculate the total revenue generated by each product type. This can help identify the most profitable products. 

Shipping Costs by Carrier: Calculate the average shipping costs for each shipping carrier to evaluate which carrier is the most cost-effective. 

Lead Times by Supplier: Calculate average lead times for each supplier to assess their reliability in delivering products on time.

Total Products Sold by Location: Determine the total number of products sold in each location to understand regional demand.

Defect Rates by Inspection Results: Calculate defect rates for different inspection results to assess product quality.

Ranking Products by Profitability: Write a query to rank products based on profitability, where profitability is calculated as (revenue generated - manufacturing costs - shipping costs).

Supplier Performance Analysis: Calculate the average lead time for each supplier and identify suppliers with lead times higher than the overall average.

Top 5 Shipping Carriers by Cost Efficiency: Determine the top 5 shipping carriers with the lowest average shipping costs per product shipped.
