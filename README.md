# Supply Chain Mastermind Project 
## Project Overview
The Supply Chain Mastermind Project leverages data analytics to transform supply chain operations, enhancing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and profitability. Through advanced analysis, dynamic visualizations, and KPI tracking, this project provides actionable insights across sales, manufacturing, and logistics.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 24 columns and 100+ rows, detailing various aspects of the supply chain:

Product Details: Product types, pricing, availability, and stock levels.
Sales Metrics: Revenue, customer demographics, and sales volumes.
Manufacturing Data: Lead times, production costs, inspection results, and defect rates.
Shipping Information: Costs, transportation modes, shipping carriers, and delivery times.

## Key Objectives
Analyze sales trends and customer demographics to optimize stock levels and availability.
Optimize manufacturing processes by tracking lead times, defect rates, and costs.
Reduce shipping costs by identifying the most cost-effective carriers and routes.
Provide KPIs to support data-driven decision-making in the supply chain.

## Tools & Technologies
Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
SQL (MSSQL Server): Queries for in-depth profitability analysis, supplier assessment, and cost audits.
Power BI: Dashboards with interactive KPIs for real-time decision support.
